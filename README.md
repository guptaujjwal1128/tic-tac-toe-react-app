# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that demonstrates basic concepts of React, such as functional components, state management, and more.

## Features

- **Functional Components**: Utilizes React functional components for building the UI.
- **State Management**: Manages game state using React's `useState` hook.
- **Game Logic**: Implements core game logic, including move handling, win condition checking, and draw detection.
- **Game History**: Tracks and allows navigation through the history of game states.
- **Reset Functionality**: Provides a reset button to restart the game.
- **Player Turn Indicator**: Displays the current player's turn.
- **Move Count**: Shows the number of moves made in the game.
- **Read-Only Previous States**: Prevents changes to previous game states, ensuring only the latest state can be modified.
